Volunteer Services
Apart from the TRI Team members listed above, we also leverage on volunteering service which allows community enthusiasts and advocates to render services to TRI especially when we have events. Volunteers reach out to us to identify with what we do, and use our platform to render community services to many individuals and communities for a better Nigeria.  The tradition of TRI is to present a letter and certificate of commendation to our volunteers at the end of the community services rendered. This is a way of giving back to our various communities and Nigeria at large. 



Success Stories
After the registration of The Regenerate initiative for Community Health and Youth Development in 2021, full-fledged activities did not start until 2023. In 2021, a few activities were executed notable of which was the payment of the medical bill of Azeez Wasiu Olawunmi who suffered from urine retention, leading urethroplasty. The patient could not pay his medical hospital bills at Alfa Clinic Sagamu, Ogun State, Nigeria. After a lot of abortive efforts, Mr. Olawunmi reached out to The Regenerate Initiative and we mobilised fund to settle the medical bill to the tune of eighty thousand naira (N80,000), equivalent of $173.52. This facilitated his discharge from Alfa Clinic in Sagamu, Ogun State.
In February 2023, TRI mobilised fund to the tune of N,712,000, equivalent to $1,544.33, to pay the school fees of three students of Kwara State University Malete, Kwara State after reaching out to us. We successfully did this and the students paid their school fees. Two of these students are in their final year (400 Level) and the other is in 300 Level.
